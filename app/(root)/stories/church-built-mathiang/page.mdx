## Background

Mathiang village lacked a permanent place of worship and community gathering. Residents met under trees or temporary shelters, limiting spiritual growth and structured community activities.

## Our Response

CCSO partnered with local church leaders and community members to construct a permanent church facility. Community members contributed labor and locally available materials, strengthening ownership and sustainability.

## Outcomes

- Improved access to spiritual services  
- Strengthened community cohesion  
- Safe space created for youth engagement and learning  

## Next Steps

CCSO will support leadership training for church volunteers and explore expanding the facility to include literacy and discipleship programs.
