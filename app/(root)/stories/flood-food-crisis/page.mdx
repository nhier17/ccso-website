## Background

Seasonal flooding across multiple counties has displaced families, destroyed crops, and cut off access to essential services. Food insecurity increased rapidly as households lost their primary sources of income.

## Our Response

CCSO deployed rapid response teams to deliver food assistance, clean water, and emergency shelter materials. Coordination with local authorities ensured aid reached the most vulnerable families.

## Outcomes

- Reduced immediate hunger among affected households  
- Improved access to safe drinking water  
- Stabilized living conditions for displaced families  

## Next Steps

CCSO is assessing long-term recovery needs, including agricultural rehabilitation and water infrastructure support to improve resilience against future floods.
