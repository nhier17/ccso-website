## Background

Thousands of children in South Sudan face barriers to education due to poverty, displacement, and insecurity. Many are forced to drop out of school, increasing risks of child labor and early marriage.

## Our Response

CCSO partnered with local schools and community leaders to identify vulnerable learners and provide comprehensive education support. Assistance included tuition fees, uniforms, books, and basic learning materials.

Special attention was given to girls, who received mentorship and menstrual hygiene kits to support consistent attendance.

## Outcomes

- Increased school enrollment and retention  
- Improved attendance, especially among girls  
- Renewed hope among families for their children’s future  

## Next Steps

We aim to expand this program to reach more out-of-school children and strengthen community engagement to support long-term educational success.
