## Background

Years of intercommunal conflict and political instability have deeply affected social cohesion in Western Lakes State. Youth and community leaders often lack access to structured platforms for dialogue and reconciliation.

## Our Response

CCSO organized peace training workshops that brought together youth, elders, women leaders, and local authorities. The sessions combined traditional conflict resolution practices with modern peacebuilding approaches.

Facilitated discussions allowed participants to share lived experiences, grievances, and aspirations in a safe and respectful environment.

## Outcomes

- Strengthened relationships across divided communities  
- Increased youth participation in peace initiatives  
- Improved understanding of non-violent conflict resolution strategies  

## Looking Ahead

CCSO plans to scale this program to neighboring counties, working with trained peace ambassadors to sustain dialogue and prevent future conflicts.
