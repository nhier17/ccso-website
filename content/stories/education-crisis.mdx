## Background

Years of conflict and economic hardship have left thousands of children out of school. Many families struggle to afford school fees, uniforms, and learning materials.

## Our Response

CCSO worked with local leaders and schools to identify vulnerable children and provide scholarships, school supplies, and psychosocial support to help them return to learning.

## Outcomes

- Increased school enrollment and attendance  
- Improved learning environments  
- Enhanced emotional well-being for supported children  

## Next Steps

CCSO aims to expand education support to additional communities and strengthen partnerships with schools to improve retention and learning outcomes.
