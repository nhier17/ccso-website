## Background

Food insecurity remains a major challenge for rural households due to climate shocks, limited resources, and low agricultural productivity.

## Our Response

CCSO supported smallholder farmers with improved seeds, tools, and hands-on training in climate-smart agricultural practices to improve yields and resilience.

## Outcomes

- Increased crop production  
- Improved household food security  
- Strengthened livelihoods for farming families  

## Next Steps

CCSO will continue monitoring harvest outcomes and plans to scale this program to reach more farming communities.
